# CodeePy

CodeePy has been created to allow Codee the robot from the Creative Science Foundation to be controlled via Python.
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/codeepy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/codeepy)

# Getting started with CodeePy

## Requirements
CodeePy requires Python 3.4 or greater to be installed on your machine, it can be downloaded for free from the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
We recommend using [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) as your initial development tool, please note students, educators and educational facilities have free access to the professional version and there is also a free community version.

## Setting up your development environment
Create a new project, being sure to specify the Python 3.4 interpreter.
Open the terminal within PyCharm and install CodeePy with pip (which will also install any dependencies)
For more information regarding pip please visit our [module page](https://pypi.org/project/codeepy/)

```python
pip install codeepy
```

## Getting started
Within your project create a new Python file, initially you will need to import CodeePy, and create an instance of CodeePy.
I have included a helper which will list your com ports, additionally CodeePy documentation can be viewed with the help(CodeePy) function below

```python
from codeePy import CodeePy

# view CodeePy Documentation
help(CodeePy)

CodeePy.get_com_ports()

# create CodeePy Instance and open connection
codee = CodeePy('<Your COM port>')
```

Now you have created your instance object please see the Example.py file to test the CodeePy functions.


## Upgrading CodeePy

```python
pip install codeepy --upgrade
```
